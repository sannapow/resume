        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>My background is in teaching, particularly teaching English in additional needs education environments. 
            I recently completed an Educational Research MSc (with distinction) at the University of Bristol; my research focus was exploring autistic learners' experiences of emergency remote education.</p> 
        <p>I am currently leading the subject of computing across the secondary stage of my school as well as running the enrichment coding course.
            So, although I have had a personal interest in coding for years, I have also created this portfolio as part of my professional development.</p>
        <p>I am currently based in the south west of England.</p>
